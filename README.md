Animation of Philly Bike Theft Data using D3 and Leaflet

This is a first attempt at showing time series point data (a la my many adventures in Processing) that lives in the web.

This viz is not-so-elegant, because it's a loop that just runs forever.  It increments a unix timestamp and pulls the thefts since the last increment from a CSV, draws them, and fades them out quickly.
